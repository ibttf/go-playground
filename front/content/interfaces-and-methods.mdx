## Methods

In Go, methods are functions attached to a specific type. They allow types to exhibit behavior.

### Defining Methods on Types

Methods can be defined on both built-in and custom types.

```go
type Circle struct {
    Radius float64
}

func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return math.Pi * c.Radius * c.Radius
}
```

### Pointer Receivers vs. Value Receivers

While value receivers get a copy of the type they're invoked upon, pointer receivers get a reference, allowing them to modify the original value.

```go
func (c *Circle) DoubleRadius() {
    c.Radius = c.Radius * 2
}
```

<Banner type="tip">
  Tip: Use pointer receivers when you need to modify the receiver value or when
  the struct is large to avoid copying costs.

## Interfaces

Interfaces abstract behavior and provide a way to express the capabilities of a type without dictating its implementation.

### What are Interfaces? Why are They Crucial in Go?

Interfaces allow types to be treated based on what they can do rather than what they are. They encourage a design that promotes decoupling and cleaner architecture.

### Defining and Implementing Interfaces

An interface defines a set of method signatures. If a type provides definitions for all methods in the interface, it implicitly satisfies the interface.

```go
type Speaker interface {
    Speak() string
}

type Person struct {
    Name string
}

func (p Person) Speak() string {
    return "Hello, my name is " + p.Name
}
```

### Empty Interfaces and Type Assertions

The empty interface (interface{}) can hold values of any type, offering a way to handle unknown or dynamic types.

```go
name := person.FirstName // John
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces in Go define a set of method signatures. They provide a way to specify the behavior of an object.

### Defining and Implementing Interfaces

```go
type Speaker interface {
    Speak() string
}

type Person struct {
    Name string
}

func (p Person) Speak() string {
    return "Hello, my name is " + p.Name
}
```

### Empty Interfaces and Type Assertions

The empty interface (interface{}) can hold values of any type, offering a way to handle unknown or dynamic types.

```go
func Describe(i interface{}) {
    fmt.Printf("(%v, %T)\n", i, i)
}

// Type assertion
value, ok := i.(string)
```

  Tip: Use empty interfaces judiciously. Overuse can lead to code that's hard to
  understand and maintain.

## Standard Library Interfaces

Go's standard library comes with many predefined interfaces that help in designing consistent and reusable code.

### io.Reader and io.Writer

The io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces are fundamental interfaces for reading from and writing to streams in Go.

```go
func ReadFrom(r io.Reader, buffer []byte) {
    _, err := r.Read(buffer)
    // Handle err
}

func WriteTo(w io.Writer, data []byte) {
    _, err := w.Write(data)
    // Handle err
}
```

### The Stringer Interface

The Stringer interface provides a method to return the string representation of a type.

```go
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}
```

  Note: Mastering interfaces and methods in Go is crucial as they lay the
  foundation for Go's type system. It allows for modular and maintainable code.
  Ensure you practice and apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.
