## Goroutines

Concurrency in Go is handled with goroutines â€“ lightweight, concurrent function executions. They allow multiple tasks to be processed in parallel or concurrently.

### What are goroutines? How do they differ from threads?

Goroutines are similar to threads, but they are more lightweight and managed by the Go runtime rather than the operating system. This design enables Go developers to spawn thousands of goroutines without the overhead commonly associated with threads.

To launch a new goroutine, simply use the **go** keyword:

```go
go functionName()
```

### Synchronization using sync.WaitGroup

While goroutines are powerful, it's essential to manage their execution. The **sync.WaitGroup** type provides a way to wait for groups of goroutines to finish executing:

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(1)
go func() {
    // Do work
    wg.Done()
}()
wg.Wait()
```

## Channels

Channels provide a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.

### Introduction to channels: make(chan T)

Channels are typed conduits through which you can send and receive values. To create a channel:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
```

### Sending and receiving from channels

You can send and receive values from channels using the <- operator:

```go
ch <- 1  // send
value := <-ch  // receive
```

### Buffered channels

Go supports buffered channels. When you create a buffered channel, you specify its capacity:

```go
ch := make(chan int, 2)  // capacity of 2
```

### Closing channels and range on channels

It's good practice to close channels when they're no longer needed. This can be done using the close() function. The range keyword can be used to read values from a channel until it's closed:

```go
for v := range ch {
    fmt.Println(v)
}
```

## Select Statement

The select statement provides another way to handle multiple channels.

### Waiting on multiple channel operations

Using select, you can wait on multiple channel operations, blocking until one of the channels can proceed:

```go
select {
case msg1 := <-ch1:
    fmt.Println("Received", msg1)
case msg2 := <-ch2:
    fmt.Println("Received", msg2)
case ch3 <- 3:
    fmt.Println("Sent 3 to ch3")
default:
    fmt.Println("No communication")
}
```

### Default select case

The **default** case in a **select** is run if no other case is ready.

## Advanced Concurrency Patterns

Go's concurrency primitives allow for the design of intricate concurrent patterns.

### Worker pools

Worker pools allow you to start a fixed number of worker goroutines to handle tasks in parallel.

### Fan-in, Fan-out

Fan-out is the practice of starting multiple goroutines to handle incoming requests, and fan-in is the practice of combining multiple results into one channel.

### Timer and Ticker

Go's **time** package provides **Timer** and **Ticker** for executing code after a set duration and at regular intervals, respectively.
